# rock-paper-scissors

## Description
I was motivated to learn game mechanics as this is my main topic of interest when it comes to programming. I jumped at the opportunity to learn with this mini-project. Ever wanted to see if you could beat a computer at rock paper scissors? Here's your chance! I gained more knowledge and practice using javascript with this fun project.
